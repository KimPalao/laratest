# laratest README

Forked from [Yet Another PHPUnit](https://github.com/danilopolani/vscode-yet-another-phpunit).

This is a simple extension that runs Laravel tests. Tests can be run on individual files and methods. 

All tests under `tests/Browser` are automatically run with `php artisan dusk`.

## TODO

Features that would be nice to have:

- Integration with [VS Code Testing API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/testing)
- Configuration
- Testing
